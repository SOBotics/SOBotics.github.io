    <p>The SOBotics chat room relies on a GitHub organization at: <a href="https://github.com/SOBotics">https://github.com/SOBotics</a>. We create bots to help with the moderation of Stack Overflow on all fronts, be it questions, answers, comments or even badges. Enjoy your stay at our room and while you’re here, please go through the rules at first.</p>
    <h1 id="rules">General rules regarding all the bots</h1>
    <p>What is the proper etiquette that should be followed while I am present in the room?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All the bots in the room have an associated FAQ and a README post. Please go through them before interacting with the bot.</li>
        <li>Any post which is reported by a bot doesn’t imply that you need to take some kind of action immediately. If you are unsure please let others to reply to those reports.</li>
        <li>Non of our bots target user, we only target posts and comments via open SE API, please be sure to follow same concept</li>
        <li>At any point of time do not pile on comments on the post. While for certain post as NAA/VLQ a comment can be useful to help OP, it's not recommended to leave comments on Heat Detector  reports (see Heat Detector FAQ)</li>
        <li>Do not link the room in comments on post as: <i>"Your post/comment was caught here"</i>, however you might invite people if they are interested to understand more</li>
        <li>Naturally there is a lot of possible to flag post, but we do not appreciate chat comments like <i>"Free flags here"</i>, since we are not developing to increase flag count but to help the community to keep SO nice</li>
        <li>Few of the bots have AI enabled in them. While they do provide some fun,  note that the room is not about speaking to them.
            <ul>
                <li>Do not extend conversations with AI enabled bots for more than one page of the transcript.</li>
                <li>Do not converse with the bots when someone else is working either with that bot or with any other bot. That would be perceived as noise.</li>
                <li>If any room owner asks you to stop the conversation, please stop it immediately.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Do not misuse the information that the bots are providing you.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>What to do when the room is mentioned on meta</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bring that post to the attention of the room owners first and then to that user who has taken action on that post.</li>
        <li>If there is a possibility of leaving a constructive comment, then please do so. Do not to leave snarky comments either in chat or on the post. Stick to the Be Nice policy.</li>
        <li>Do not pile on the post, both in chat and on the post.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Do you want to develop a bot?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ping any one of the room owners. They’ll provide you with assistance related to creating a chat interface, etc.</li>
        <li>Do not create a bot account where you’ll use it as a sock puppet. Moderators visit the room frequently and can bust your bubble.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Do you want to bring a bot to the room?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ping any of the room owners and ask their permission at first. Ask that particular room owner to add a pinned message that states the purpose of your bot in the room.</li>
        <li>While all bots are welcome, it must be noted that the core principle of the room is to create bots that are helpful for moderation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 id="find">SOCVFinder's FAQ</h1>
    <p>SOCVFinder is for user with >3K reputation and gold badge holders to find duplicates, we expect these users to review correctly the questions presented by bot</p>
    
    <h1 id="heat">Heat Detector's FAQ</h1>
    <p>Stack Exchange has provided a <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/327148/5292302">feed of offensive comments</a> which allows for testing and serves a base for the classifying algorithms. However, <b>do not use this as a witch hunt to find users and harass them</b>.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Commenting back on a SO post to a heated comment is, in general, a very bad idea. Avoid commenting in most, if not all cases. A Room Owner might decide to stop the bot if the room is involved in any bad situation (using the command <code>@Queen stop feed</code>) and kick the users involved.</li>
        <li>It is not allowed to speak about the users that posted reported comments in the chat room. We do <b>not</b> moderate users, but comments.</li>
        <li>When multiple offensive comments are exchanged or someone is going well over the top, please remember to flag the thread for moderator intervention. They are not automatically notified of the comments' deletion.</li>
        <li><code>tp</code> should be used for "not nice" comments or comments that lead to offensive ones or offensive / spam posts (answer / question). You can flag the comment or the post approprietly.</li>
        <li><code>tp socvr</code> can be used to send a notification to the <a href="http://socvr.org/">SOCVR room</a>. This should only be used when the comment is very rude and requires immediate attention to avoid flame posts and / or repeatingly offense from other users.</li>
        <li><code>fp</code> should be used for comments that were wrongly reported (i.e. they are on-topic and constructive).</li>
        <li>It is up to you to give feedback when and if you want to. You can abstain from giving one if you feel the comment is hard to classify (borderline).</li>
        <li>As a general guideline, please don't pile on flags unless the comment really warrants it. Only one flag is enough for a moderator to take a look and act on it.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1 id="natty">Natty's FAQ</h1>
    <h2 id="natty-userscripts">Userscripts</h2>
	<p>In order to help with giving feedback to Natty, a userscript has been developed, called <a href="https://github.com/Tunaki/stackoverflow-userscripts/blob/master/NattyReporter.user.js">NattyReporter</a>. It listens to NAA and VLQ flags that are raised, and automatically sends a report to Natty in chat. Additionnally, it adds a 'Natty' link below each post, in which you can select a proper feedback to give for that post.

###Answers just to say Thanks!
Please don't add _"thanks"_ as answers. They don't actually provide an answer to the question, and can be perceived as noise by its future visitors. Once you [earn](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/146472) enough [reputation](http://$SITEURL$/help/whats-reputation), you will gain privileges to [upvote answers](http://$SITEURL$/help/privileges/vote-up) you like. This way future visitors of the question will see a higher vote count on that answer, and the answerer will also be rewarded with reputation points. See [Why is voting important](http://$SITEURL$/help/why-vote).

###Link Only Answers
A link to a solution is welcome, but please ensure your answer is useful without it: [add context around the link](//meta.stackexchange.com/a/8259) so your fellow users will have some idea what it is and why it’s there, then quote the most relevant part of the page you're linking to in case the target page is unavailable. [Answers that are little more than a link may be deleted.](//$SITEURL$/help/deleted-answers)

###NAAs by < 50 rep
This does not provide an answer to the question. You can [search for similar questions](//$SITEURL$/search), or refer to the related and linked questions on the right-hand side of the page to find an answer. If you have a related but different question, [ask a new question](//$SITEURL$/questions/ask), and include a link to this one to help provide context. See: [Ask questions, get answers, no distractions](//$SITEURL$/tour)

###NAAs by > 50 rep
This post doesn't look like an attempt to answer this question. Every post here is expected to be an explicit attempt to *answer* this question; if you have a critique or need a clarification of the question or another answer, you can [post a comment](//$SITEURL$/help/privileges/comment) (like this one) directly below it. Please remove this answer and create either a comment or a new question. See: [Ask questions, get answers, no distractions](//$SITEURL$/tour)

###'Me too!'
Please don't add _Me too!_ as answers. It doesn't actually provide an answer to the question and can be perceived as noise by its future visitors. If you have a different but related question then [ask](http://$SITEURL$/questions/ask) it (reference this one if it will help provide context). If you're interested in this specific question, you can [upvote](http://$SITEURL$/help/privileges/vote-up) it or leave a [comment](http://$SITEURL$/help/privileges/comment) once you have enough [reputation](http://$SITEURL$/help/whats-reputation).

###Link only (SO link)
This should be a comment, not an answer. If it is a duplicate question, [vote to close](http://$SITEURL$/help/privileges/close-questions) as such and/or leave a comment once you [earn](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/146472) enough [reputation](http://$SITEURL$/help/whats-reputation). If not, tailor the answer to this specific question.

###Spam
Excessive promotion of a specific product/resource may be perceived by the community as **spam**. Take a look at the [help], specially [What kind of behavior is expected of users?](http://$SITEURL$/help/behavior)'s last section: _Avoid overt self-promotion_. You might also be interested in [How to not be a spammer](http://$SITEURL$/help/promotion) and [How do I advertise on $SITENAME$?](http://$SITEURL$/help/advertising).

###Question posted as answer
This post isn't an actual attempt at answering the question. Please note [$SITENAME$ doesn't work like a discussion forum](http://$SITEURL$/about), it is a Q&A site where every post is either a question or an answer to a question. Posts can also have [comments](http://$SITEURL$/help/privileges/comment) - small sentences like this one - that can be used to critique or request clarification from an author. This should be either a comment or a [new question](http://$SITEURL$/questions/ask).

###Editing NAA in review
Please don't edit those posts that aren't answers. Editing in review clears the current flag and stops the deletion process. You should "Recommend Deletion" instead, or Skip if you're not sure.

###Editing VLQ in review
Please don't edit link-only answers when you cannot salvage them. As is, they aren't answers and should be deleted. Editing in review clears the current flag and stops the deletion process. You should "Recommend Deletion" instead, or Skip if you're not sure.</pre>
